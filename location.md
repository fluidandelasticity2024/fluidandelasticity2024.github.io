# Location and practical information
![Arcachon](/assets/img/arcachon.jpg)
The conference will take place in the Palais des Congrès d'Arcachon located on
the beachfront, in the seaside resort of Arcachon, France. Participants will be accomodated in hotels located only
a short walk away from the conference center.

## How to get there
The city of Arcachon is serviced by a direct train line from Bordeaux (Bordeaux Saint-Jean train station)
that runs every hour (one way ticket 12.20 €). Train tickets from Bordeaux to Arcachon can be purchased **<a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/nouvelle-aquitaine/trajet-bordeaux-arcachon"> online </a>**.
However, if you have to travel to Bordeaux by plane (arrival at Bordeaux Mérignac airport), **you will have to get to the train station first**.  

**From Bordeaux/Mérignac airport to Bordeaux Saint-Jean train station** - There are three ways to reach the train station of Bordeaux Saint-Jean from the Bordeaux/Mérignac airport.
- *By tramway (most convenient solution, 55 mn)*: the tram station *Aéroport Mérignac* (tram line A) is located is front of the arrivals area (Hall B). Tram tickets (1.70 €) can be purchased **<a href="https://boutique.infotbm.com/products/1"> online </a>** or at the ticket vending machines available at the airport tram station. From the airport, the tram line A does not go directly to the train station ; take tram line C to the Saint-Jean train station at the connecting tram station *Porte de Bourgogne* (details of the tram journey from Bordeaux Mérignac Airport to Bordeaux Saint-Jean train station available **<a href="https://www.infotbm.com/fr/itineraires/resultat/route-0?from_type=stop_area&from=stop_area%3ATBT%3ASA%3ATAEROPO&to_type=stop_area&to=stop_area%3ATBT%3ASA%3ATSJEAN&departure=true&date=20230530T104905&transports=commercial_mode%3ATramway%2Ccommercial_mode%3ABus%2Ccommercial_mode%3AFerry&wheelchair=false"> here </a>**).

## Eat & drink
There are many restaurants in Arcachon, most of them being located on the bay beach (*la Plage du Bassin*), just a stone throw from the hotels.
You will find a wide choice of restaurant, ranging from pizzerias to sea food restaurants. Here are some good places you can try:
- *Pizza Nofa Arcachon*, 25 Boulevard du Général Leclerc, Tel.: +33 (0)6 99 20 00 33

## Visiting the surroundings
**Going to the Oceanside and the Dune du Pilat** - The Palais des Congrès and the hotels are located in front of the bay, but the other side of the town (a neighbourhood named Le Moulleau)
faces the Cap-Ferret. If you push a bit further south, you will reach the highest sans dune in Europe - the Dune du Pilat - and eventually the Ocean beaches (plage de la Salie etc). You can get easily to both places
by means of the local bus lines (ligne 3 and ligne 101, 1.70 €, bus schedules **<a href="https://www.bassin-arcachon-info.com/dune-du-pilat-arcachon-baia1/"> here </a>**).

**Sailing to the Cap Ferret** - It is worth spending an evening in the Cap-Ferret, a small town located at the end of a peninsula, on the other side of the bay.
There you will be able to visit the old town and enjoy oisters and a glass of white wine or tapas on a terrace right by the see.
To go there, you will have to get on a "pinasse", a typical boat of the Arcachon bay. Tickets may be booked in advance (recommended) on the **<a href="https://bateliers-arcachon.com/"> website  </a>** 
of the "Union des bateliers Arcachonnais" or directly purchased on the Thiers pier, nearby the Hotel de la plage (return ticket: 20 €)

**Sailing to "L'Ile aux Oiseaux"** - L'Ile aux Oiseaux (Birds' Island) can be visited in a thousand different ways. The most common, however, is the guided tour by boat.
Many service providers offer tickets to get to l'Ile aux Oiseaux. Again, tickets can be purchased on the **<a href="https://bateliers-arcachon.com/"> website  </a>** 
of the "Union des bateliers Arcachonnais" or directly on the Thiers pier (single tour without stopover, 2 h: 24 €; single tour with a stopover
at the Cap Ferret, 2 h: 31 €).
