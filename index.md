# Fluid and Elasticity 2024
## Arcachon, France, 17 – 19 juin 2024

## Objective

The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers of different communities (applied mathematics, biomechanics, fluid mechanics, physics) working on fundamental problems involving coupling between a fluid and a deformable body.

Contributions of work in progress or completed are welcome. The last ‘Fluid & Elasticity’ conference was held in <a href="https://fluidelasticity2019.wordpress.com">2019 in Málaga, Spain</a>. The upcoming edition will be held in the coastal city of Arcachon, France. It will take place over two and a half days (June 17-19 2024) and will consist of single plenary sessions with five invited lectures (40 minutes) and about 40 selected oral presentations (20 minutes), with ample time outside the formal sessions for participants to meet in a convivial atmosphere.
